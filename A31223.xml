            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THIS Miracle of Female Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, whoſe Life and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are our preſent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, was Young, Spright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and very Beautiful; Three Dangerous Advantages when they are attended with thoſe Qualifications, for which ſhe was no leſs Famous, namely, <hi>Craft, Impudence,</hi> and <hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> and an inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable
<pb facs="tcp:109316:4"/> Longing after other People's Goods; and all theſe ſtrengthned by a natural Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity, as being the Iſſue of Parents, who, inſtead of giving a timely Check to theſe Vicious Inclinations, rather incouraged her in them by their ill Example, as being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the ſame themſelves from their Youth.</p>
               <p>Signior <hi>Trapaſſa,</hi> Father to this worthy Perſon, whoſe Atchievements we intend to Relate, had been Condemned to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, for having Aſſumed to himſelf an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Knighthood, before he had made the neceſſary Tryals, upon which the King beſtows that Honour, by the Sovereign Council of <hi>Portugal.</hi> His deſign in doing it, was, that he might the more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently follow his Profeſſion of Stealing about the Court, where he was Reſpected as a Knight; and the better under that Cloak to play thoſe Pranks of Villany, wherein he was ſuch a Profeſſor, that the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Thief might have learnt Leſſons from him.</p>
               <p>A certain Woman whom he uſed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Trade withal, was ſo Incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, upon the Account of ſome Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, that he reſerved not all his Kindneſs for her, that ſhe put in a Charge againſt him, the Iſſue whereof was, that he was preferr'd to the Gallies, where he paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109316:4"/> the Term of his Condemnation, and ſomewhat more. He was put into that Squadron of Slaves, which is called the Squadron of <hi>Spain,</hi> and turned over from <hi>Toledo</hi> to St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Port, with the reſt who were in the ſame Predicament of Slavery. He made an Attempt to recover his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the Plot being diſcover'd, he was put to greater Hardſhip than he had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe been.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Lady <hi>Eſtephania</hi> (ſo was the Jealous Woman that had ſhewed him that Trick, called) underſtood he was gone to Exerciſe that painful Employment, tho' ſhe was not of an over Compaſſionate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet ſhe very ſeriouſly Repented that ſhe had been the Occaſion of his Miſery; and conſidered, that ſhe could not make better Satisfaction for that Injury, than by proffering herſelf to him in Marriage, as ſoon as the time of his Pennance was Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>And what inclined her the more to this kind of Reparation was, that ſhe had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a Daughter by him, which Child is the Heroine of our preſent Hiſtory. With this Reſolution ſhe left the Court, and went to <hi>Sevil,</hi> hoping in that great and famous City, ſhe might the ſooner hear ſome News of him, whom ſhe had Reduced to ſuch a wretched Condition, and whom ſhe would
<pb facs="tcp:109316:5"/> once more have gladly ſeen at Liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſtephania</hi> had a Houſe well Furniſhed, being a <hi>Genoeſe</hi>'s Widow, who had left her very well to paſs: That, and the Care ſhe took to go in rich Cloaths, gained her ſuch Repute at <hi>Sevil,</hi> that ſhe was lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as ſome Perſon of Quality, but ſhe ſoon loſt that, when the Relation of her Life came to be known; eſpecially this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of it. That out of an exceſs of Jealouſy ſhe had preferr'd a young Gallant to the Gallies, whom ſhe had often entertain'd on a Feather bed. This imprudent Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made her Abominable in the Opinion of the moſt intimate of her own Sex, whoſe Indignation ſhe allow'd to be more juſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, when ſhe conſider'd, that ſhe had Proſtituted her ſelf to an Impoſtor, and a Raſcal fit only for the Gallies.</p>
               <p>Theſe Reaſons and Reproaches, obliged her to remove from <hi>Madrid</hi> to <hi>Sevil,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying all ſhe could conveniently with her, and Selling the reſt, which brought her in a conſiderable Sum of Money. Having thus order'd her Affairs, ſhe went towards <hi>Sevil</hi> by Coach, with two Maids to wait on her, intending to continue there, till the time of <hi>Trapaſſa</hi>'s Serving in the Gallies was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, for ſhe kept an exact Account of it, which being near out, ſhe underſtood that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gallies were arrived ſafe at St.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109316:5"/> 
                  <hi>Mary</hi>'s Port. She immediately went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not in ſo high a Dreſs as ſhe wore at <hi>Sevil,</hi> but in a more modeſt Habit, that ſhe might not be afterwards Reproach'd, That ſhe was Wife of a Galley-Slave, whom ſhe had Courted out of Chains to her Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>She was ſoon Informed that her Gallant was in the Captain's own Galley, very Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund, and advanced to the Office of a Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a Preheminence among the Slaves which Exempts them from Rowing, which he had acquir'd of the General by the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of his Converſation; and was by this time ſo well acquainted with the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that he ſeemed not to Value whether ever he came out of them. But the arrival of <hi>Eſtephania</hi> Remedied all. Her firſt Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was to Treat about his Liberty with thoſe Perſons on whom the Matter depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and feeding them with Money, <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſa</hi> had no Knowledge of her Deſign, as not having ſeen her, nor ſtir'd out of the Galley; ſo that he was much Surprized when he came to underſtand that ſome Perſon did not only Sollicit his Freedom, but was likewiſe Liberal of their Money to procure it; for it never entred into his Thoughts, that his old Love <hi>Eſtephania,</hi> ſhould have changed the cruel Humour he had left her in, into Mildneſs and Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb facs="tcp:109316:6"/> for him. All things being agreed on, for <hi>Trapaſſa</hi>'s Diſcharge, his Chains were ſtruck off, and he was told, he might go whither he would. In the mean time could not tell who had been the Author of that Happineſs, which was no ſmall one, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that when poor Slaves have ſerved out the time of their Condemnation; yet there are ſome Pretences found to hinder their being ſet at Liberty; ſo that though they have been Sentenc'd only to Serve 4 Years, yet have been forced to remain in Servitude Five or Six.</p>
               <p>Signior <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> was extreamly Aſtoniſht when he found himſelf in the Preſence of <hi>Eſtephania,</hi> who ſtood waiting on the Shoar to receive him, and perceiv'd, that it was only by her means that he had recovered his Freedom. She received him with open Arms; and he, to expreſs his Gratitude, returned the like obliging Careſſes to her: So that the Kindneſs he had now received from her, made him quit his Reſentments for the Miſeries ſhe had occaſion'd him. He was ſomewhat Diſturb'd that ſhe did not appear in that Habit which he had left her at <hi>Madrid,</hi> as being ignorant of her Deſign in Diſguiſing herſelf; nor could ſhe at that time give him an Account of it, by reaſon the Captain and others who deliver'd him, were preſent, and whom ſhe was obliged to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109316:6"/> entertain at Dinner. Having Treated 'em very handſomely, all withdrew, ſave only <hi>Trapaſſa,</hi> who continued ſtill with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs. Finding themſelves alone, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated their Careſſes, and outvied one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Aſſurances of the Satisfaction they received by that Interview. <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned her Thanks with all the grateful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments imaginable, for the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Charge ſhe had been at, and the Goodneſs ſhe had ſhewn in freeing him from the worſt of Slavery. On the other ſide, <hi>Eſtephania</hi> ask'd his Pardon for the Miſchief ſhe had procur'd him, and all the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes her Malice had Occaſion'd to him; telling him withal, That ſhe could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin any other way to Repair the Injury ſhe had done him, but by joyning Hands with him in Matrimony if he lik'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, ſince ſhe had a Daughter already by him, and Wealth enough for both of them to live at their Eaſe.</p>
               <p>I leave you to Judge, Whether this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not Pleaſing to <hi>Trapaſſa,</hi> who was ready to catch at the leaſt Offer of Good Fortune, upon his coming out of ſo ſevere a School of Pennance. So that his Anſwer was in renewing his Embraces, ſatisfying her with what Joy he accepted of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Bargain ſhe Propoſed to him; in treating her to give him an Account of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109316:7"/> his Daughter, whom he was paſſionately Deſirous to ſee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſtephania,</hi> over-joy'd to find his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo Agreeable to her Expectation, preſented him with a noble Riding Suit, which ſhe had purpoſely cauſed to be made for him; and the next Morning betimes they took their Journey towards <hi>Sevil,</hi> where <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> finding his Daughter then about Eight Years old, he acted a part that he had never done before, that is, he was ſolemnly Married to the Lady <hi>Eſtephania</hi> in the Face of the Church. They changed their Lodgings to another Quarter of the City than that where they had formerly dwelt, being reſolved to live another kind of Life than they had done before. For <hi>Eſtephania</hi> believing that the Hardſhip her dear Love had endured in the Gallies, had cured him of ſome of his former Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, and that the Grey Hairs he had brought from thence, would Reclaim him from his Debauches. She endeavour'd to procure him ſome Credible Employment in <hi>Sevil,</hi> as well to keep him out of Idleneſs, as that he might thereby bring in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing toward Houſe-keeping. But an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Diſpoſition which was in <hi>Trapaſſa,</hi> could not eaſily be brought under Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and if he had behaved himſelf a while with ſome Reſervedneſs, it proceeded from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109316:7"/> Influence of the Admonitions and Rebukes which his Wife continually gave him, and not out of any virtuous Inclination; ſo that through his own Neglect, he could find out no other Buſineſs but frequenting Gaming-Houſes, Play-Houſes, and other vicious pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where thoſe who are Naturally inclined to Sloth, uſually waſte moſt part of their time. This courſe of Life extreamly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his Wife; who yet willing to avoid all Matrimonial Diſcontents, wink'd at his Diſorders, and endeavour'd to find ſome Comfort in the Converſation of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe Beauty was already become the common Diſcourſe of the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> having no ſettled Buſineſs, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being the Seminary of all Vices, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted him to follow his former Courſe of Gaming, the Gulf wherein ſo many fair Eſtates have been ſwallowed up. He began at firſt to Play at ſmall Games, as if for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation only, but afterwards venturing ſtill higher, he in a ſhort time took the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to lay Hands on the Goods of his Wife. She was ſenſible enough, that too many of her things were wanting, and doubted not but her Husband had conveyed them away; but all ſhe could do, was, to weep and bemoan her Misfortune, which ſhe charged upon no body but herſelf. <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſa</hi> perceiving her ſo much diſturbed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109316:8"/> Reformation, but the curſed Humour of Gaming continuing upon him, his Luck was ſo bad, that he Pawned or Sold every thing of Value in his Houſe. Finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at length reduced to pinching Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he began to Contrive how he might again Retrieve himſelf. He would have been content that his Wife, who was yet Handſome, ſhould have turned Common Proſtitute, tho' ſhe had but juſt Recovered her Reputation; but he perceived ſhe was grown ſo Honeſt, and ſo alter'd from what ſhe had been before, that he had not the Confidence to mention it to her: For ſhe grew ſo extream Melancholly at the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd Demeanour of her Husband, that ſhe ſeem'd in a manner careleſs of all things, and little regarded the Education of her Daughter, who was by this time come into the Teens, and by reaſon of theſe Diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions between her Parents, liv'd as ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, appearing every Day at the Window, not with a little Affectation.</p>
               <p>The Grief and Regret which poor <hi>Eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phania</hi> conceived at her being reduced to Penury, brought her into a Sickneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhe Died about a Year after, with a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Repentance for her paſt Follies, in Hopes to Die as Happy a Death, as her Husband had occaſion'd her living an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Life. She was very meanly Buried,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109316:8"/> 
                  <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> not having wherewithal to beſtow much on her Funeral. He was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at her Death, and acknowledged but too late, his great Overſight in returning to his ill Courſes; whereas, if he had taken her Advice, he might have lived Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the reſt of his Days. All the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort he had now leſt, and the Hope on which he depended for a Livelyhood, was the Beauty of his Daughter, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd ſo Charming, as might procure him a Son in Law, who would Relieve his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, never conſidering, that in this Age Riches are commonly preferr'd before Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and that Graces and Perfections have ſeldom much Power in them, if Wealth be lacking.</p>
               <p>The unfortunate <hi>Trapaſſa,</hi> though op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with Miſeries, could not forbear frequenting the Gaming Houſes, not indeed to play himſelf, for he had not wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but to get ſome ſmall Preſent from the Gameſters when they had a good Hand, as is uſual in <hi>Spain</hi> to be beſtowed upon thoſe that look on, and is commonly the only Revenue of thoſe that have Ruin'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by that pernicious Diverſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trapaſſa</hi> being ſeldom at home, it gave his Daughter the greater freedom to follow her own Sentiments. She would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually looking out of the Window, which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109316:9"/> induc'd a great number of Young Gallants to repair to the Street where ſhe dwelt. The Father was not Ignorant how matters went, and though he might have prevented yet winkt at it, in hopes to ſee his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantageouſly Married, to help him out, as being the moſt likely means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve his Misfortunes. He therefore left the little <hi>Roſina,</hi> ſo was his Daughter call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to her own Liberty, hoping that by her Inſinuations, ſhe would in time have the Diſpoſal of the Hearts and Purſes of thoſe that Courted her. His Deſigns proved more ſucceſsful than he imagined; for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many that Languiſhed for her, there was one very Rich, who was Tranſported with the Love of her. She aſſumed the Title of <hi>Donna,</hi> an Honour which belongs only to Perſons of Noble Extraction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her Mother had uſed it before, and if ſhe had not, her Daughter would have taken it up, as being a Dignity that Coſts little or nothing.</p>
               <p>The Perſon who was ſo remarkably her Servant, was Agent for ſome Affairs in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru;</hi> a Gentleman whoſe Credit much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Eſtate, and was accounted very Rich, belonging to the Enſuring Office in the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt Indies,</hi> and about 50 Years of Age. Though he was ſatisfied that his M ſtriſs had no Fortune, and that he muſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109316:9"/> alſo maintain her Father, yet he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take her for Better for Worſe; from whence we may deduce this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That when Love has once taken Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of an Aged Perſon, it is very Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to Diſpoſſeſs him. <hi>Laurentia de Sava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> this Amorous Elder was named, who was ſo inchanted with the <hi>Beauty</hi> of <hi>Roſina,</hi> that the Treaty of Marriage was concluded in leſs than Eight Days, and he had the Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of an Happineſs, which he thought would have laſted him as long as he Lived. He took his Father in Law into his Family: though he knew him to be a great Gameſter. The firſt Days of the Nuptials were ſpent as they uſually are at ſuch Solemnities; he furniſhed his Wife with new Gowns, Rings, and Jewels, ſuitable to his Condition; for being a Perſon pretty well ſtricken in Years, he was no Lover of Exceſs, an Humour not very Pleaſing to <hi>Roſina,</hi> who minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as rich Cloaths, and Long'd for whatſoever ſhe ſaw worn by Women of a Quality much above her; and this much Cooled her Love to her Husband, who was of an <hi>Indian</hi> Diſpoſition, ſomewhat Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and careful not to Waſte his Eſtate; and being ſenſible that her Father was an Old Gameſter, who had run out all, he durſt not Truſt his Wife with keeping the Caſh, nor with the Expences of his Houſe,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109316:10"/> This Proceeding quite Defeated the Hopes of <hi>Trapaſſa,</hi> who imagined, that upon this Marriage, he ſhould Command all that was in his Daughter's Power, being ſtill poſſeſt with the reſtleſs Spirit of Gaming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſina</hi> Obſerving her Husband was Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about his Affairs, took Occaſion to go abroad every Morning, under pretence of going to Church, to Pray that ſhe might be a Mother; with this Excuſe ſhe blinded her Husband, the true Motives of theſe Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies being to appear in the Streets, and at Maſs. A Citizen's Son of <hi>Sevil,</hi> taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of her, fell inſtantly in Love with her, one of the moſt Debauch'd Young Men of his time; who had reduced himſelf by his Lewdneſs, into as bad a Condition al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, as <hi>Trapaſſa.</hi> His Name was <hi>Ruperio,</hi> a very comely Beau, who proved ſo Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in Courting <hi>Roſina,</hi> that ſhe was wholly at his Devotion, expecting to receive ſuch Preſents from him, as might put her in a Garb agreeable to her Beauty, above what ſhe could obtain from the Miſer her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
               <p>The firſt Demand ſhe made to him, was ſomewhat Modeſt, conſidering ſhe was a Merchant's Wife, namely, to beſtow on her a Gown of the ſame Silk and Faſhion that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Neighbour of hers had, whom ſhe named and a Gold Watch for her ſide, promiſing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109316:10"/> him, in Requital of theſe Favours, not to Deny him any thing that was in her Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <hi>Roſina,</hi> by his inſolent Boaſtings, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that he had Thouſands at Command, and he likewiſe promiſed to Comply with her Deſires; but being unable to perform the ſame, he contriv'd how to get that by his Wit, which his Purſe would not reach to. He happen'd to be well Acquainted with the Lady, whoſe Gown he was to match, and going to her, intreated her to Lend it him; pretending it was only for the Repreſentation of a <hi>Comedy</hi> which was to be acted in a Nunnery. He could not be Denied upon ſuch an Account; ſo that at the end of Three Days, which time he told <hi>Roſina,</hi> it would take up to make it, he ſent it to her Houſe, when her Husband was abroad in the City about his buſineſs. The Watch he told her was not yet finiſh'd, but ſhould ſuddenly be brought her; intreating her in the mean time, to accept of another of leſs Value, as a Pledge for the Security of the other. She returned him Hearty Thanks, extreamly Pleas'd to find he was ſo Punctual, and to ſhew herſelf Grateful, gave him all the Satisfaction he could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from her.</p>
               <p>He took leave of <hi>Roſina,</hi> who intended to Perſuade her Husband, that a Kinſman of hers had ſent her that Gown from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:109316:11"/> to prevent his being Jealous of her. On the other Hand, <hi>Ruperio</hi> reſolved, if poſſible, to get it again, and return it where it was borrowed. <hi>Savaria</hi> having no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, he effected the matter by the following Trick.</p>
               <p>Four or Five Days after the delivery of the Gown to <hi>Roſina, Ruperio</hi> puts himſelf into the Habit of a Serving Man, and about Dinner comes to <hi>Savaria</hi>'s Houſe, ſaying, he was Servant to the Lady to whom the Gown belong'd. <hi>Savaria</hi> order'd him to come in, who told him, he was ſent by his Miſtreſs, for the Gown ſhe had Lent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Roſina,</hi> only to ſee the Faſhion of it. <hi>Savaria</hi> turning toward his Wife, ask'd her what Gown the Fellow would have? She preſently knew her Gallant: <hi>Friend,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>come hither to Morrow Morning, and you ſhall have it. But my Miſtreſs,</hi> replies <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio, has commanded me not to come back with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; for this Afternnoon ſhe is to go to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtning, at which ſhe is to be Goſſip, and ſhe muſt needs have it. How ſhall I know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> cryes ſhe, <hi>that you belong to that Lady, and that you came from her?</hi> The crafty Spark, perceiving what ſhe deſign'd, and that ſhe had no mind to return it; <hi>The Gown,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is of ſuch a Colour, trim'd in ſuch a manner, and was ſent you in a Green Cloth, done about with a Silk Fringe. Savaria</hi> hearing him give ſuch
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109316:11"/> particular Marks; <hi>Sweet-heart,</hi> ſaid he to his Wife, <hi>You have nothing to reply, for ſince he demands it with ſo much earneſtneſs, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but his Miſtreſs has occaſion for it; and if you are unwilling to riſe out of your place, give me the Key of your Trunk where it is, and I will fetch it. Roſina</hi> had not a Word more to ſay, but being ready to burſt with Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe aroſe from the Table, took the Gown out of the Trunk, and delivering it to <hi>Ruperio, Give my humble Service,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>to Madam</hi> Leonara, <hi>and tell her, I ask her Pardon that I did not ſend it home ſooner, which I could not do, becauſe the Perſon for whom I borrowed it, was not here ſince.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The diſguiſed Gallant received the <hi>Gown,</hi> and left <hi>Roſina</hi> with her Eyes all on Fire, and vext to the Soul to find herſelf ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently affronted. <hi>Savaria</hi> askt her upon what account ſhe had borrowed it, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, That it was at the Requeſt of an Acquaintance of hers, who was deſirous to have ſuch another, as being extreamly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the Colour and Faſhion of it.

               <p>With that they both drew, <hi>Felician</hi> maintaining that he only ought to pretend to her, and <hi>Ruperio</hi> ſtanding upon the ſame Terms. The diſpute was ſoon ended, his Sword who was in preſent poſſeſſion, was the moſt fortunate, <hi>Ruperio</hi> by a mortal wound falling dead upon the place. The noiſe of their Swords was not very great, for <hi>Felician</hi> had done his work ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that none heard any thing of the quarrel but only <hi>Savaria,</hi> who for his own repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109316:17"/> would have kept it ſecret. That the body might not be found in that place, <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lician</hi> took it on his ſhoulders, and laid it at the Gate of a Monaſtry, and took refuge in another, till he heard how matters would go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Savaria</hi> confounded at what he had ſeen and heard, was ſo enraged againſt his Wife that he began to contrive how to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd of a Woman, whoſe perfidiouſneſs was the more Notorious, becauſe of the great reaſon ſhe had to be Grateful and Loyal. She was faſt aſleep in bed, never dreaming what had happened in the ſtreet upon her account. The firſt thing that came into <hi>Savaria's</hi> thoughts was to go up inſtantly and diſpatch her in bed with a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but he then conſidered that the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer having carried away the dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from his door, he might be charg'd with Killing her without any cauſe, and that he ſhould want proof, as having for Witneſſes only two Servant Maids, who were more likely to ſwear againſt him. He therefore reſolved as the ſureſt way, to rid himſelf of her by a ſecret Doſe of Poyſon which might remove her after a certain time; but then he thought he ſhould not ſatisfy his own juſt Reſentments if he any longer delay'd that vengeance which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red immediate execution. He then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109316:17"/> to himſelf another Expedient, which was to leave both the City and his Wife, and to retire to ſome other place, but this deſign was ſoon over, he having many Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs undetermined; and fearing the Siniſter opinions which might have been made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a Reſolution, to the Scandal and Shame of a man of his Age and reputation.</p>
               <p>This Reflection brought him to his firſt deſign of ſending her going with the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard. But before he perpetrated that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, which yet according to <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Juſtice, was no Crime, but a juſt puniſhment for her Lewdneſs, he judged it neceſſary for his own Vindication, to leave in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the reaſons that induced him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this Fact. He took Pen and Paper and began to ſet down the affront he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from his Wife, and the ſatisfaction he had taken; but upon reading it, imagining he had not ſufficiently expoſed the heinouſneſs of her Fault, he tore what he had written and this he did to the third time, ſo great was the diſturbance and confuſion of his thoughts. He ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down to Write the Fourth time, but upon ſecond thoughts was of opinion that he ſhould be ſufficiently aveng'd if he had but once ſent his Wife out of the World. A great part of the night waſted in theſe diſquiets, namely in Writing, Correcting,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109316:18"/> and Tearing all he had Written. At length being abſolutely reſolved in that fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to proſecute his deſign, he made another Writing without any blot, having before well conſidered what he ſhould ſet down; and when he had expreſt in the beſt manner he could, the irreparable injury he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, he was ſuddenly ſeiz'd with ſo preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a grief that he fell down and expired.</p>
               <p>All this paſs'd while <hi>Roſina</hi> ſlept. Awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a ſudden and not finding her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in bed with her, She called him, but hearing no anſwer, ſhe ſlipt on her Gown and went into his Cloſet, where ſhe found a Candle lighted, and <hi>Savaria</hi> lying on the Floor dead. She was aſtoniſht, as well ſhe might; all ſhe could do was to call up her Maids, who immediately came to the Sight of this ſtrange Spectacle; they were no leſs ſurpriz'd than their Miſtreſs at the ſtrangeneſs of this Accident. As they were going to convey the Corps to one of the beſt Rooms in the Houſe, before the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours had any notice of the adventure, <hi>Roſina</hi> found a written Paper which ſeem'd not to be quite finiſh'd, wherein ſhe found theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">That my Juſtification may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known to all thoſe who ſhall read this Paper, I declare that all my unhappineſs proceeds from the Lightneſs and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109316:18"/> of my infamous Wife, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning the holy Sacrament of Marriage, by the Sacred Bond whereof we were joined together in the Face of the Church, without any conſideration of the true Love and affection I had for her, hath proſtituted her ſelf to two Gallants at the ſame time, who having quarrel'd for the precedency which either of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have over his Adverſary, the more unfortunate was killed by the other before the Window of my Houſe. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus been witneſs of my own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and heard the whole Story of my diſhonour, it was but juſt I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge my diſgrace, thus</q>— Here ended the writing, for death ſeizing him at that word he inſtantly gave up the Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſina</hi> was ev'n diſtracted with what ſhe Saw and Read; So that for ſome time ſhe was deprived of her Senſes, upon reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that generally the greateſt ſecrets of Debauchery are diſcovered at laſt, either by Reformation or Puniſhment of the Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. The Death of her Husband afflicted her both with fear and grief; Fear to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how ſuddenly he died, occaſioned by the wrong ſhe had done him; Grief, to ſee her Husband deprived of Life, and her ſelf ignorant how to repreſent ſo unhappy an Accident. A little Remorſe of mind, like
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109316:19"/> a qualm over her Stomach, troubled her that ſhe had been ſo perfidious to a man who had loved her ſo well, and by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage had raiſed her from beggery to plenty. The great kindneſs which the neighbours were ſenſible he always had for her, gave her a little Relief, and induced her to take the Advice of one of her Maids; which was to carry her Husband's body into his bed, and to cry out the next morning ſo loud that they might hear her; whom by her exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Lamentations ſhe might perſuade that ſhe found him dead by her ſide when ſhe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the morning; and that her two Maids to carry on the Cheat, ſhould give out, that their Maſter was ſubject to an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexy, and died ſuddenly thereof.</p>
               <p>Having thus concerted their deſign, day came, <hi>Roſina</hi> cried out, and lamented with all her might; the next Neighbours coming in found her undreſſed, weeping, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her hair like one abſolutely deprived of her Wits for the loſs of ſo tender an Husband. Her two Maids acted their parts to the Life; relating the cauſe of their good Maſter's death.

The Body was laid in a little place nigh the Monaſtry, with two lighted wax Candles; and ſoon after a Man paſſed by who knew <hi>Ruperio,</hi> He told them what he was, and then went and carried the ſad news to his Friends, who were extreamly greived at his death, his Father having often fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, him that he would come to ſuch an end; for, from the Life he led, nothing leſs could be expected. He was buried in the Cloyſter, and ſtrict ſearch made for the murtherer; but <hi>Sevil</hi> being a vaſt and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous City, no diſcovery could be made of him, only <hi>Roſina</hi> knew who it was by the abſence of her Gallant, by <hi>Ruperio's</hi> death, and by the Paper ſhe found in her Husband's Cloſet; and was extreamly pleaſed to ſee her ſelf Revenged of a Perſon who had put ſuch an unhandſome Trick upon her; and it was her good fortune that no notice was taken of the blood of the deceaſed in the

He was one of the moſt accompliſht Perſons in point of Thei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of any of his time, but very fearful of falling into the hands of Juſtice, leaſt ſome of his former Offences ſhould riſe up in Judgment againſt him: which were ſuch as had prefer'd him to the Gallies, where he had made an acquaintance with <hi>Trapaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> and continued it at <hi>Sevil.</hi> This Man whoſe name was <hi>Garray, Roſina</hi> took to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt her in compaſſing her intrigues.

               <p>They paſſed by the Garden juſt as the Gardner was opening the door. <hi>Garay</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up to him, <q rend="margQuotes">Friend, ſaid he, here is a Lady would not willingly go into the City to Day, if you will afford her entertainment this night I will ſatisfy you according to your deſire, beſides that, you will do us an extraordinary kindneſs, for you will thereby prevent a great misfortune which we cannot otherwiſe avoid.</q> The Gardner, who was afraid of his Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's diſpleaſure, told him he durſt not be
<pb facs="tcp:109316:23"/> ſo bold as to receive any Perſon into his Houſe without his knowledge, though he had not expreſly forbidden him the doing of any ſuch thing. But <hi>Garay,</hi> who knew the value and power of money, took ſome out of his pocket, with which <hi>Roſina</hi> had furniſht him, and offering it to the Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Here Friend, ſaid he, take this in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of more. The Gardner's Wife long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know what buſineſs they might have with her Husband, comes up to him, and ſeeing the proffers were made him, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to Lodge the Gentlewoman in her own Room, aſſuring her Husband their Maſter ſhould never know it, in regard their Rooms were at ſome diſtance from his. Briefly, the Wives argument prevailed, ſo that the Gardner was content the Lady ſhould lodge ſecretly that night in his houſe upon the Receipt of Six Rials, which <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ay</hi> gave him as an earneſt of a greater Sum. He therefore took <hi>Roſina</hi> off her Horſe, and brought her into the Garden, where ſhe took leave of <hi>Garay,</hi> who had already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Orders, whereof we ſhall give an account hereafter.</p>
               <p>Being come into the Gardner's Room ſhe took off what covered her face; and aſtoniſhed the Gardner and his wife, at the Sight of her beauty, though ſhe ſeemed to be very melancholly, as if ſome great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109316:23"/> had befallen her, namely, that which ſhe had got by heart, and deſigned to relate to <hi>Marquina,</hi> in caſe ſhe ſhould come to the ſpeech of him. The Sun was hardly ſet when he came into the Garden, the Negro entring a while before to open the door, which he himſelf lock'd on the inſide, and carried the Key with him. He chanc'd to be that night a little more wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than ordinary, which occaſioned his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bed betimes, after he had eaten ſome of his Garden Fruits, with a piece of Bread, and waſh'd them down with a glaſs of ſpring water. He only viſited that Part of the Houſe where he lodged himſelf, and came not to the Gardner's, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly eſcaped not his privy ſearch when he thought of it. His Family, which kept more Faſting-days than ever the Church appointed, Supp'd that night very ſoberly in imitation of their Maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marquina</hi> got up in the Morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and gave his ſlave Money to go to Market, while he went about his affairs in the City, with order to get Dinner ready a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his return. <hi>Roſina</hi> was at a loſs how to compaſs her deſign, things not happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning according to her expectation; but ſtill waiting for an opportunity, She told her Entertaineſs that ſhe was extreamly troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at her Uncle's ſtay, as ſhe called <hi>Garay,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:109316:24"/> that her melancholly was upon that account, though the Gardner's wife, who was a good hearty Woman, found her all the diverſion ſhe could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marquina</hi> came home at noon, intending to dine in his Garden; but before he ſat down, he would needs take a turn about it, to ſee if any thing were amiſs, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome Knots that wanted boards to keep them in order, he went to the Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's to ſee if he could find any fit for his purpoſe. The Gardner's wife perceiving him coming, in all haſte thruſt <hi>Roſina</hi> into a little back Room, where ſhe her ſelf was wont to lye; yet could not do it ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, but that <hi>Marquina</hi> coming in, heard the Ruffling of the Silk, and ſaw the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Roſina.</hi> He ſteps into the Room where ſhe was, and led her out by the hand; Coming into the light, he was ſurprized at her handſomeneſs. The Gardner's Wife wondred that her Maſter inſtead of chiding her, as ſhe expected, only ask'd her who the Lady was; ſhe replyed, that the Night before paſſing by her door, with an antient Gentleman, who ſeemed as ſorrowful as her ſelf, they had very earneſtly intreated ſhe might Lodge there but that night, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void a great misfortune that would have happened to them, if they had gone any further.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Marquina</hi> was ſo enchanted therewith, that diſcarding his unſociable and covetous humour, he told the Gardner's Wife, that ſhe had done well in entertaining the Lady, though without his Orders, which in ſuch a caſe were not to be obſerved, where Compaſſion and Charity plead for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of thoſe that are in Trouble; <q>This Lady, ſaid he, deſerves a better Reception than ſhe found in your poor Lodgings, I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proffer her the uſe of my Houſe, if ſhe will honour it with her preſence.</q> 
                  <hi>Roſina</hi> return'd many thanks for his Civility, and intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to allow her the privacy of ſome other Lodging, for the little time ſhe had to ſtay there; in regard ſhe expected an Uncle of hers, to come and fetch her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that night.</p>

Moved with Compaſſion to ſee ſuch a gallant young Man ſo diſadvantagiouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, I came down to the Gate, calling my Maids about me to ſee what might be done for his relief, our Houſe being in an obſcure ſtreet, and very few appearing at the noiſe we made, and thoſe unarmed, ſo that they were unable to part them. We brought the young Man in, lockt the doors, and a Surgeon was inſtantly called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His wounds were ſo deſperate, that we thought beſt to put him to Bed in a ground Room where my Brother uſed to lye.</p>
                  <p>The young Man thanked me very Civilly for this Favour, but alas! that good Office begun in Compaſſion, ended in Love. The Surgeon viewed his wounds, but could not at preſent give any certain Judgment of them, though he whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered me in the ear that he judged them mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. This word ſtruck me to the heart, for having ſeen him fight ſo Valiantly, I muſt needs acknowledge that I had an inclination for him; but his kind expreſſions afterwards, his gentele manner of acknowledging my Kindneſs, and the obligations I had laid upon him, raiſed it into a perfect Love. My Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther returned from their Viſit, and before they came home, were told by one of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours what had happened to a Perſon of Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their abſence, and that I put a period to

When they ſaw the young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman they commended the charitable office I had done in ſuch an extremity, they being Perſons who embraced all opportunities to exerciſe their kindneſs to the diſtreſſed.

For my part, my troubles increaſed more upon me, for my Father never giving me any notice of it, as if I had been a Perſon not at all concerned, concluded the contract with the <hi>Granadine,</hi> and gave him his word he ſhould marry me; when I came to underſtand it, I was ſo diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in my mind, that I regarded nothing I was about; this new Servant of mine, who expected e're long to be my Maſter, came to give me a Viſit, but was ſoon ſatisfied that he had recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without his Hoſteſs: for having flattered himſelf into a fooliſh imagination that he ſhould have found the Kindeſt Reception in the world fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The expected hour being come, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy hour to me, conſidering the many misfortunes I have ſuffered ſince; as my Deareſt and I were going out of the Houſe, and croſſing another ſtreet, we met my Jealous Servant, who had ſpent ſome nights to diſcover what he now found too true. He preſently knew us, and being attended by his Servants, fell upon <hi>Leonardo,</hi> never think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any ſuch ſurpriſe. So that before he had time to draw his Sword, he received three mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal wounds, and fell down dead, without ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Word. The noiſe the Murtherers made, occaſioned the Neighbours to come out with their Lights, upon the appearance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they retired to prevent being diſcovered. By this time there was a great ſtir at my Father's, for my being miſſed; while I was in a manner dead to ſee my Love lying breathleſs at my Feet. Being a little recovered, I thought it not convenient to ſtay in the ſtreet after ſuch an Accident, ſo I went in all haſte, to a Friend's Houſe of my Father's, an aged Perſon, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poor, to whom I related what had befallen me, and how much it concerned me not to ſtay any longer at <hi>Granada;</hi> whereupon getting a Horſe, he mounted me thereon, and brought me to the next Village, where he got another, and came from thence hither to avoid the fury of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109316:29"/> my Father, who accompanied by Officers, makes a ſearch after me, as I have underſtood by the way. For that reaſon I thought it not ſafe for us to go into <hi>Sevil</hi> as ſoon as we came hither, but that I had better conceal my ſelf in ſome place near it. It was the pleaſure of Fortune to direct me to this Habitation of yours, into which upon my extraordinary Intreaties, your Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ventured to receive me this laſt night. Thus, Sir, you have the ſtory of a wretched Maid, if there ever was any; whoſe only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort now is in the kind entertainment you are pleaſed to afford me, and I doubt not but your Charity will be requited, ſince there can be none more greater than to Relieve ſuch as are Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and perſecuted in that deplorable manner as I am.</p>

They continued ſome time together, ſhe Sobbing and Crying as if it had been for a Wager, and he uſing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109316:30"/> his utmoſt endeavours to comfort her; which yet came not up to the height of propoſing a Remedy, as ſhe could have wiſh'd, for he had not yet abandoned his covetous humour.</p>
               <p>Having with much niceneſs, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſidered the great beauty of <hi>Roſina,</hi> with her Afflictions and ſtrange Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he concluded that this happineſs was as it were fallen into his mouth, as a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal addition to his former proſperity. This was the firſt time that ever Love attackt <hi>Marquina's</hi> heart, and therefore acted more violently; Is <hi>Marquina</hi> fallen in Love? He muſt needs then be Liberal. Hath he entertained <hi>Roſina</hi> into his Houſe? That kindneſs will be the deareſt to him that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he had. O Love, what diſpoſitions doſt thou not change, and what heart is ſo hard, that it is not in thy power to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? Love hath changed the temper of this inſatiable Miſer, who had caſt off all ſenſe of humanity to his neareſt Relations, into a Liberal and magnificent Lover. He is extreamly ſmitten with <hi>Roſina,</hi> he is paſſionately in Love with her; and ſhe will e're long be Miſtreſs of his Heart and Wealth too. She related many improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things in her ſtory, which might have betrayed her, had not the affection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Marquina</hi> harkned to her cloſed both
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109316:30"/> his Eyes and Ears; nay he was ſo bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this Paſſion, that he would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved more unlikely things than theſe.</p>
               <p>The effect of this doleful Narration of <hi>Roſina</hi> was, that <hi>Marquina</hi> aſſured her of all the favour and affection ſhe could expect from him, even his Eſtate, Life, Heart, and Soul, making her the abſolute Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of all he was poſſeſt of; Intreating her to forget her misfortunes, and to be confident that ſhe was in an Houſe where ſhe might command, and all her Orders ſhould be ſtrictly obeyed, as far as it was in his power. <hi>Roſina</hi> returned him many thanks for his generous Offers, concluding her Compliments with a freſh ſhower of Tears; which ſhe had at command when ever ſhe pleaſed or ſtood in need of them.</p>
               <p>With theſe Artifices, ſhe became Miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs of <hi>Marquina,</hi> and all he had, ſo that ſhe might diſpoſe of him and it as ſhe pleaſed. Her Beauty had wounded him, and he was mighty deſirous to Try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe would be as willing to Cure him. But he cannot contrive how to acquaint her with his malady. He reſolved at laſt that if he could not prevail upon her by Submiſſions and Preſents, he would uſe the laſt Remedy, which was to marry her. This is a Bait that many times catches the moſt Subtle of that Sex; but he that uſes
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:109316:31"/> it has cauſe moſt commonly to repent. <hi>Ro-Roſina</hi> had no other deſign than to examine the Cheſts of the greedy Merchant, and would be no way engaged till ſhe was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of the Prize; for the raſcally Trick <hi>Ruperio</hi> had play'd her, made her extream diſtruſtful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marquina</hi> ſtaid all that day in his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and neglected his buſineſs in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but next Morning, leaving his Lady aſleep, he takes his Mule, and goes about his ordinary occaſions, having charged the Gardner's Wife to provide a good Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt for his Miſtreſs as ſoon as ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, and to have a care of the Houſe. He lock'd the Chamber door where his Money was, and as he went out command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gardner not to ſuffer any one to come into his Garden, but the old Man that brought <hi>Theodora</hi> thither, for that was the name the hypocritical <hi>Roſina</hi> had given her ſelf.</p>
               <p>He then went away attended by a little Negro, to whom he gave Money to buy proviſion for dinner. <hi>Roſina</hi> got up, and the Gardner's Wife punctually perform'd the Orders ſhe had received from her Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Treating her the beſt ſhe could, that ſo all the Servants might be partakers of this magnificence. <hi>Roſina</hi> comes down into the Garden, where ſhe took occaſion to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109316:31"/> commend the Walks and Contrivances of it, for the Gardner kept it in good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and well furniſhed with Herbs, Fruits, and Flowers.</p>
               <p>Finding the Sun beginning to grow hot, ſhe went into the Houſe, where meeting with a Lute on which <hi>Marquina's</hi> Factor was wont to play. She put it in Tune, and made that her Entertainment, till <hi>Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> return'd from the City, who hearing her playing on it, was wonderfully plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to find one perfection in her more than he knew before. She perceiving that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quina</hi> hearkned to her Muſick, joined her Voice to the Inſtrument to enchant him more if poſſible than he was already. She ſung ſo ſweetly that <hi>Marquina</hi> was raviſhed at the Muſick, ſo that he made her this high Complement, that he could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to be the voice of any mortal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but rather that of an Angel deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from above; and coming towards her Tranſported with Joy, How, ſays he, hath my poor Habitation been honoured by your Retirement into it, moſt adorable <hi>Theodora?</hi> What happineſs hath your arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val bleſt me with, who never knew any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? What Felicity have I received in beholding your Tranſoendent Beauty, and to obſerve in you a thouſand unknown ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109316:32"/> which I could not diſcover a firſt ſight.</p>
               <p>You preſs too hard upon me, Dear Sir, replies the counterfeit <hi>Theodora,</hi> and put me to the bluſh with your exceſſive Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; I am not ſuch a Stranger to my ſelf, but that I muſt account it Flattery, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſuch extraordinary Commendations on a Perſon that deſerves ſo little; Had I miſtruſted you had heard me I would have defer'd my diverſion to another time, ſince probably my voice may ſeem untunable to you compar'd to the excellent Songſters in this City; unleſs generous natures have an inclination to favour Perſons of mean performances, and perſuade them their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments exceed what indeed they are. No more compliments I beſeech you, dear Lady, ſays <hi>Marquina,</hi> now raiſed up to the higheſt pitch of beſotted Love; My expreſſions proceed from my heart, and I can aſſure you, Madam, that though I have heard celebrated Voices in <hi>Sevil,</hi> yet yours is beyond any of them.</p>
               <p>Your moſt humble Servant, ſays <hi>Roſina,</hi> the honour you are pleaſed to allow me, makes me heartily wiſh that my poor abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities might find you ſome further diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with this Inſtrument, ſince you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge your ſelf ſo much ſatisfied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; But my Troubles are ſo great and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109316:32"/> Preſſing that I only minded my own caſe in what I did. I muſt ſee your Sorrows at an end, replies <hi>Marquina,</hi> before you leave this Houſe, Let me intreat you therefore, ſweet Lady, if you cannot abſolutely free your mind from Ruminating upon your Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet to condeſcend to a ſhort Ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them. This renewing of your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſays ſhe, muſt needs extreamly oblige me, and conſequently force me to a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful compliance with your Commands, as far as lies in my power; but I cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe it you ſo fully as you wiſh; becauſe that the Perſon that brought me hither, ſeems to have forgot that he was to return and fetch me away; otherwiſe he would have found ſome means to have given me a Viſit once in three days. Let not that create you any trouble, replies the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Merchant, but rather imagine there may be ſome juſt cauſe for his neglect; I am ſomewhat apprehenſive, ſays ſhe, that he may be returned to <hi>Granada,</hi> for fear leaſt being miſs'd, he ſhould be queſtioned as acceſſary to my eſcape; and this would prove the greateſt of all my Misfortunes, for if he be gone, he hath carried all I had along with him. Never fear that, cryes <hi>Marquina,</hi> for he muſt have more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion than to forſake you in ſo great an extremity; but though he and all others
<pb facs="tcp:109316:33"/> fail you, aſſure your ſelf I ſhall not, and I implore you to believe this my ſincere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, that I am ſo paſſionately your Servant, that I cannot think my ſelf the ſame Perſon I was before I ſaw you.</p>
               <p>He then proceeded to make an abſolute diſcovery of his Love to her; but the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Gipſy pretending ſhe did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his meaning, returned him a Civil Anſwer to the proffers he made her; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating her former acknowledgments for his kindneſs, and not doubting the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of what he out of his natural good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was pleaſed to promiſe her. Dinner was now come in, and they both ſat down; the entertainment was very Noble and Suitable to the Love of the Founder, who ſeemed to have baniſhed all buſineſs and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice out of his mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſina</hi> and <hi>Garay</hi> had agreed together, that he ſhould come to her when he was ſure the old Merchant was abroad, and that he ſhould diſguiſe himſelf like a Beggar, ſo as not to be known, nor any ſuſpicion might be conceived by him. She had contrived ſeveral ways to defraud the Merchant of ſome part of his Treaſure, but could fix on none that ſhe thought might prove effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual, the Room wherein it was lock'd up being ſtrongly Fortified, but at length ſhe cunningly diſcovered the place where the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109316:33"/> wretched Miſer hid the Keys of his Iron Cheſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marquina</hi> went as uſual into the City, which being obſerved by <hi>Garay,</hi> he comes to the Houſe in Beggar's Weeds with two Crutches. Being got under the window where <hi>Roſina</hi> look'd out, he begg'd an Alms of her.

               <p>The next Day <hi>Garay,</hi> who was well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in ſuch Affairs, procured ſome others of the ſame Profeſſion to aſſiſt him in the Work; and having obſerved <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quina</hi> going into his Houſe, they ſtaid till he was gone to Bed, which was ſomewhat late; for <hi>Roſina,</hi> who held a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with them, had purpoſely kept him up. About Midnight <hi>Garay</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades brought a Thing in the ſhape of a Man, ſtuffed with Straw, with a Cloak which covered his Face, and planted it on a Stake over-againſt the principal Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow toward the Garden, which was that part of the Houſe where <hi>Marquina</hi> lodged. The Night was ſomewhat dark, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for their Plot. Having thus placed the Figure, they knockt ſo loud at the door, that it might have been heard from one end of the Garden to the other. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quina</hi> awakned thereby, leaped out of his Bed, being ſurprized at what had never happened to him before. He called to his Servant, and bid him ſee who knockt; he between ſleeping and waking, went and? cry'd as loud as he could, Who knocks there But no body anſwering, and he not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <hi>Marquina</hi> thereupon got into bed again, and compoſed himſelf to reſt, but it was ſoon interrupted; for <hi>Garay</hi> knockt more violently than before, which ſo aſtoniſhed him, that he ſent his Man the ſecond time to know what the matter was; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with the ſame account, that he could ſee no body. <hi>Marquina</hi> got up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and calls out of the Window, <hi>Who knocks at the door thus unſeaſonably?</hi> No an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer being made, he grew more inraged, but looking a little more ſtoutly about the Houſe than his Servant had done, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Figure planted before his Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. <hi>Marquina</hi> was extreamly ſurprized at the ſight of the Perſon who had made that great diſturbance, and yet gave him no Anſwer; and aſſuming more Courago than he was naturally maſter of, he bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cryed out, <q rend="margQuotes">'Tis baſely done of you, Sir, to abuſe me thus, you ſhall find that I am a Perſon that will not ſuffer ſuch Affronts, pray walk about your Buſineſs, and do not affront me any more, except you think your ſelf invulnerable, and that a brace of Bullets will make no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on your inchanted Skin.</q>

<pb facs="tcp:109316:41"/> Sollicitations of the Party Robb'd. She was got far enough off e're he was ſenſible of his loſs; for the next night, after they had carried off the Money, ſhe and <hi>Garay</hi> hired two Mules, and came to <hi>Carmona,</hi> about half a days Journey from <hi>Sevil;</hi> they had beſpoke two Places in the <hi>Madrid</hi> Coach, which was to paſs through that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and take them up as they paſſed by. They lighted at one of the beſt Inns in <hi>Carmona,</hi> where <hi>Roſina,</hi> Keeping out of Sight, expected the Coach; pleaſing her ſelf with the thoughts of what preferment ſhe might come to in time, being already Miſtreſs of four thouſand Crowns in Gold, which with a little Silver was all that this penurious Miſer had ſcrap'd together du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his whole Life, with much Pains, and many an hazardous Voyage to Foreign Countries.

               <p>The Coach which our Fortunate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers expected to carry them to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> came at its uſual time to <hi>Carmona.</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:109316:41"/> There were in it already Six Perſons, a Gentleman, and his Lady, a Prieſt, Two Univerſity Scholars, and a Servant belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Prieſt, a Young Lad about 15 years of Age. They all knew that there were two Perſons to be taken in at <hi>Carmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who had paid ſomewhat extraordinary for the beſt Places; they accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned them when they ſaw them come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Coach; but <hi>Garay</hi> who was a very Civil and obliging Perſon, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his to the Gentleman's Lady, whom he ſeated on the left ſide of <hi>Roſina,</hi> and ſate himſelf at the forepart of the Coach with her Husband. All being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to their content, they thought it a great happineſs that they had met with ſo good Company. But <hi>Roſina</hi> and <hi>Garay</hi> had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecret ſatisfaction ariſing from the thought of the good prize they had brought into ſuch agreeable Company. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was a Perſon of excellent diſcourſe, the Prieſt of a very ſociable humour, and the Scholars made it appear that they had not miſpent their time in the Univerſity, every one being deſirous to make the beſt diſcovery he could of his Abilities.</p>
               <p>Being come within a Musket ſhot of the ancient City of <hi>Corduba,</hi> the Metropolis of the Kingdom while the Moors were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd of all <hi>Spain,</hi> after Sunſet, an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109316:42"/> accident caus'd them to make a halt. Two Gentlemen being come out into the Fields upon a challenge which one had ſent the other, and having fought, one was run through the Body in two ſeveral Places; which had obliged his Adverſary to make his eſcape, and get into ſome Church for Sanctuary. The wounded Perſon cryed out for a Prieſt to receive his Confeſſion juſt as the Coach paſſed by, which being heard, the Prieſt who was named Doctor <hi>Monſalio,</hi> could do no leſs than get out, accompanied by <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Roſina,</hi> who had a great deſire to ſee the wounded Man. They came to him and as ſoon as the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor had received his Confeſſion, and given him Abſolution, he loſt his Speech, being ſupported by <hi>Garay.</hi> The Prieſt returned to the Coach, and having called ſeveral times upon <hi>Roſina,</hi> who pretended ſhe could not get away <hi>Garay.</hi> The Coachman per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it grow dark, put on his Horſes, having ſent them word what Inn he ſhould take up. <hi>Roſina</hi> was much troubled to ſee the Coach gone, having left her and <hi>Garay</hi> behind, charitably exhorting the Dying Perſon to Repentance; but he was ſo far gone, that to ſpare their further exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he gave up the Ghoſt. They were much troubled what to do with the Body, when ſome Officers of Juſtice came to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109316:42"/> them, who ſeeing at a diſtance the dead Perſon in the Arms of <hi>Garay,</hi> and a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſtanding by, and having likewiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice before, that two Men were ſeen to go out of the City with a deſign to fight a Duel, preſently imagined that <hi>Garay</hi> was one of them, and conſequently the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer of the other; upon which preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was ſeized and ſent to Priſon, and order given to the Goaler to take care to ſecure him. <hi>Roſina</hi> had more favour, being confined in one of the Officers Houſes, with a charge to ſee her forth coming. They both uſed all the Arguments they could to clear themſelves from being any way concerned in the murder, alledging upon what occaſion they came to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but their own words would not be taken, and it was preſumed the Duel had been upon the account of the Woman; the Judge order'd her to be brought to his own Houſe to be farther examin'd: when ſhe came thither, the Room was full of Gentlemen, and among others a very rich <hi>Italian</hi> Merchant, whom ſome buſineſs of his own had brought thither; they had no ſooner ſeen <hi>Roſina,</hi> but they all admired her Beauty and majeſtick Air, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Italian,</hi> who was of an amorous Conſtitution. <hi>Roſina</hi> was much offended that ſuch an affront ſhould be put upon
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109316:43"/> her by the way, being ſenſible that if they were detained the next day, She ſhould loſe the opportunity of continuing their Journey. The Judge askt her ſeveral queſtions about the Duel, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's death; who replied, ſhe knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the occaſion; but was coming in the <hi>Sevil</hi> Coach to go to <hi>Madrid,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by ſome other Perſons then in an Inn in that Town, which ſhe named; that as the Coach paſs'd by, a certain Perſon who had been wounded in the High-way not far from them, call'd out for ſome Perſon to receive his Confeſſion, and that a Prieſt who was with them went out to do it, whom ſhe alſo followed out of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, accompanied by an Uncle, who went along with her to ſee the wounded Man.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Judge ordered in regard it was grown late, that the buſineſs ſhould be adjourn'd till next day, that a more ſtrict inquiry might be made into it, and in the mean while, that all who came in the Coach, ſhould not ſtir from <hi>Corduba</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out permiſſion. <hi>Roſina</hi> was then brought back to lodge in the Officer's Houſe that night. The <hi>Italian</hi> who lodg'd not far from it accompanied her; but though he had lived at a far greater diſtance, he would have thought the way but ſhort to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109316:43"/> wait upon a Lady with whom he was deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Love. He took his leave of her at the Officer's Houſe, aſſuring her that he ſhould think himſelf happy to ſerve her in all things that lay in his Power, for which ſhe thanked him; reckoning it only as a Compliment. But the vexation ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at her being thus unexpectedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, brought her into a Tertian Feaver.</p>
               <p>The next day all the Perſons who came in the Coach heing examined, gave the ſame account that <hi>Roſina</hi> had done before. whereupon <hi>Garay</hi> was ſet at Liberty.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109316:45"/> great. He was a great Student, and had been at the Univerſities of <hi>Pavia</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna</hi> before he came Heir to his Brother, who died a very rich Man in <hi>Spain,</hi> and that Eſtate occaſioned him to marry at <hi>Corduba.</hi> He had ſo paſſionate an affection for <hi>Roſina,</hi> that he uſed all means poſſible to Inſinuate himſelf into her favour; and upon that account offered her the uſe of his Country-Houſe to take the Air, and recover her indiſpoſition; hoping that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her there, he ſhould more eaſily compaſs his deſires. She had been told by <hi>Garay</hi> that this Merchant was well fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and eaſy to be Plum'd, and ſince that good luck had fallen to them by chance, they ought to make the beſt advantage of it.</p>
               <p>That night they only Supp'd together, and every one went to their reſt it being very late; though the <hi>Italian</hi> pretended he would have returned to lie in the City; But his Servants whom he had before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, purſuaded him not to go abroad at that unſeaſonable time of the night, for fear of meeting with Thieves, or the Preſs-Maſters who were abroad, and many times did a great deal of Miſchief, and robbed all they met. At laſt ſeeming to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded not to ſtir out, he was glad to paſs away ſome part of the night in diſcourſing
<pb facs="tcp:109316:45"/> with <hi>Roſina,</hi> and being got to bed, his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was to conſider by what means, and how with the leaſt charge he might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe the prize he aimed at.

               <p>The Merchant ask'd whether ſhe would pleaſe to ſee his Garden; who replyed, ſhe was extreamly obliged to him for the trouble he gave himſelf to divert her, and to ſatisfie him how kindly ſhe took that favour at his hands, went along with him juſt as ſhe was, without putting up her hair, which hanging over her ſhoulders ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded much to her beauty, and it is not to be doubted but ſhe had ſome deſign in it. Her new Gallant thought it an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary favour to have her by the hand, and in that poſture. She ſaw the whole Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſeeming much pleaſed with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfulneſs of it.</p>
               <p>Having Recreated herſelf with him till the Sun grew hot, She returned into the Houſe, after which diſcourſing of many things, ſhe deſired to ſee all the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The <hi>Italian</hi> being very willing that ſhe ſhould view his wealth, ſhewed her a great number of Fine Pictures, done by the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:109316:46"/> 
                  <hi>beſt Painters in Europe, Some very rich pieces</hi> of Tapeſtry, Cabinets of Ebony of ſeveral Faſhions, Embroidered Beds. All ſorts of Houſehold Stuff of great value, and all other things requiſite for furniſhing a Houſe fit for a Noble-man. Having ſeen all the Rooms he opend a Curious Cloſet which was full of Books richly bound, and neatly diſpoſed into gilt Drawers, <hi>Garay</hi> who was with them opens one of them, and finds in it the Works of <hi>Rugmundus Lullius,</hi> with ſeveral other Philoſophical Books. The Merchant perceiving him taken up with the peruſal of thoſe Books ask'd him what he lookt at ſo attentively; <q>I find, Sir, Said he, a great many Books of Chymiſtry, and from the Curioſity I obſerve in your Collection of Treatiſes of this kind, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you have ſtudied that Science. 'Tis true, ſays the <hi>Italian,</hi> I have ſpent ſome time in the peruſal of thoſe Authors; But how far I pray are you acquainted with them. Only ſo far, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the other, that I have ſpent the beſt part of my Life in that Study; Nay then, cryes the <hi>Italian,</hi> you muſt needs be a very great Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt. I am not to acknowledge what I am, replies <hi>Garay,</hi> we ſhall talk another time of theſe matters more at large;</q> I ſhall only tell you, that beſide theſe Authors, I have Read all I could ever meet with on that Subject.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:109316:47"/>
               <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> being mighty Joyful to hear this News, ſaid, <q>I am extream glad that this Science pleaſes you, I having a particular inclination for it; I know it very well, anſwers <hi>Garay,</hi> (having already reſolved to put a Trick upon him) but in regard I put great confidence in you, I will tell you a thing in your ear which you will be much ſurprized at; that my Neice without ſtudying knows as much in a manner of this Art as I do; and is very fortunate in the practick part of it; But I intreat you not to ſpeak to her about it, for ſhe would not take it well, as being unwilling any one ſhould know it.</q> 
                  <hi>Garay</hi> could not have thought upon a more likely way to bring the <hi>Italian</hi> into the Snare; for his Avarice was ſuch, that he would bave parted with his Soul to find out the Philoſopher's Stone, hoping that if he once got that Secret he ſhould wallow in Gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſina</hi> buſied her ſelf at the other end of the Cloſet, while <hi>Garay</hi> made this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the <hi>Italian,</hi> and was looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome other pleaſant Books, for there were of all ſorts; yet not ſo atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive but ſhe heard ſomething of <hi>Garay</hi>'s diſcourſe concerning Chymiſtry, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Merchant was much taken with it. The truth is, <hi>Garay</hi> had ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that Science, and had ſpent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Sum of Money to find out the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109316:47"/> Philoſopher's Stone, which though many have ſought, yet could not any affirm they had met with it; and <hi>Garay</hi> only expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the folly of thoſe who ſpent their time and Money in ſuch ridiculous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions; Being glad that he hoped now to have met with an opportuniny to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſome part of what he had Squandred away therein.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Italian</hi> crediting all that <hi>Garay</hi> told him, imagined himſelf ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Prince. He informed him that in that very Houſe he had all things requiſite to make the Experiment; and thereupon brought him into a Room full of furnaces, Alembicks, Glaſſes, and Crucibles, with all manner of Chimical Inſtruments, and good ſtore of Charcoal. <hi>Garay</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, concluded the Merchant would be eaſily deluded, and ſeem'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that though he imagined he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all the Books he had Treating of that Art, yet that he only knew ſo much of them as would ſerve to bring him into a ſnare. The diſcourſe was adjourned at that time Dinner being brought in; which being ended, <hi>Garay</hi> pretended to take a Nap, leaving the Merchant alone with <hi>Roſina,</hi> to whom he took occaſion to make a full diſcovery of his Love; aſſuring her all he had was at her Service to diſpoſe of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:109316:48"/> as ſhe pleaſed, She ſeem'd to entertain the offers of his affection with much kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which gave him ſome ſlight hopes. She ſhewing her ſelf very pleaſant to him.</p>
               <p>Having ſeen a Lute in one of the Rooms, ſhe deſired to have it brought her, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping her Muſick, which was excellent, might have the ſame effect on the <hi>Italian,</hi> as it had on <hi>Marquina.</hi> The Merchant who had little skill at that Inſtrument him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was very glad to hear ſhe could uſe it, ordred it to be given to her, ſaying, that his deceaſed Wife play'd admirably well upon it. <hi>Roſina</hi> then took up the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and ſhewed her accompliſhment therein with ſuch Dexterity that the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> was aſtoniſhed, and to Vanquiſh him abſolutely, ſhe ſung an Air to it with ſuch a Grace, that he was at a loſs which to admire moſt, her Hand or her Voice, ſhe received the exceſſive commendations he gave her with a modeſt Bluſh, a thing ſhe could command, though never acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſhame, and made him this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Signior <hi>Octavio</hi> what I have done was only for your diverſion, be pleaſed to receive it as a Sign of the deſire I have to endeavour your ſatisfaction; which yet I have not done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reluctancy before a Perſon of ſo delicate an Ear as your ſelf, who no doubt are uſed to hear the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109316:48"/> beſt Voices in the World.</q> I never heard any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to yours, (replies <hi>Octavio</hi>) therefore I beſeech you, let not your Modeſty make you inſenſible of your own Worth, and to think my Approbation above it. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <hi>Roſina</hi> had laid by her Lute, he deſir'd her to make uſe of it a while longer, and to oblige him with one Song more; which to pleaſe him, ſhe comply'd with: and he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon renewed his Compliments to her, with Thanks for the Favour; which ſhe ſeemed modeſtly to declare were not juſtly due to her. He then retired, that ſhe, as well as himſelf, might take a little reſt.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Garay</hi> inſtead of ſleeping, was contriving how to gain the <hi>Philoſopher's Stone</hi> (not for the credulous <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> but out of him) He had ſo far perſuaded him of his Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in that Science, that he deſired nothing ſo earneſtly, as to be ſo well skill'd in them as he was, only out of a Deſign to ſatisfy his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable Covetouſneſs. He imagined, that if he could find it out, a Rock, upon which ſo many Eſtates have been loſt and thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, all his Houſhold-Stuff ſhould be of Gold, and that he ſhould become as rich as <hi>Croeſus,</hi> and the wealthieſt Men in the Kingdom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to him, would be little better than Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars.</p>

As to <hi>Octavio</hi>'s Courtſhip, he was much better treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than before, in as much as ſince the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of Marriage, <hi>Roſina</hi> the better to carry on the Cheat, grew more kind to him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in <hi>Garay</hi>'s Abſence, which ſo beſotted the Coxcomb, that he thought himſeif the moſt happy Man in the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Octavio</hi> about this time, received a Bill of Exchange of a conſiderable Sum, which he was to pay within 20 Days after Sight; this, with the Breaking of ſome of his Debtors in other Countries, made him afraid he muſt do the like, if his Attempts in Chimiſtry pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unſucceſsful.

               <p>There now happened an Affair, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged <hi>Octavio</hi> to take a Journey, to adviſe with a Correſpondent of his, how to prevent the Misfortune that hung over his Head. <hi>Garay</hi> and <hi>Roſina</hi> being entruſted with the Houſe, thought it a fair Opportunity to diſlodge, and make the beſt they could of the preſent Game, they ſecured all the Money and Jewels they could come at, and left the Plate and ſome other things they could not conveniently carry away behind them, though with ſome Regret; thinking it more Prudence to make a ſafe Retreat with what was conſiderable, than to hazard all by graſping too much.

Not long after, <hi>Criſpin</hi> being upon the Recovery, and like to follow the ſame Way, made his Eſcape out of Priſon at Noon Day in Women's Cloaths, to the great Surprize of the People, who long'd to ſee him Executed, and the great Trouble of the Jaylor, who was thought to have conniv'd thereat, by being corrupted with Money; but he clear'd himſelf by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Perſon who had furniſh'd him with the Cloaths wherewith he diſguiſed himſelf; who for that Crime was condemned to the Gallies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roſina</hi> and <hi>Garay</hi> were by this Arrived at the Imperial City of <hi>Toledo,</hi> where they had reſolved to ſettle themſelves, and to gain the greater Reputation, ſhe pretended that <hi>Garay</hi> was her Father, and took a fine Houſe in the moſt eminent Street of the City; her Train conſiſting of a Slave ſhe had bought at <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi> a Waiting-Woman, a Lackey, and a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman Uſher, when ſhe lived at <hi>Toledo.</hi> She put on the Habit of a Widow, and went by the Name of <hi>Donna Emeritana,</hi> pretending to be Deſcended from an illuſtrious Family of that Name in the Kingdom of <hi>Portugal. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi> was decently cloathed for a Man of his Age, and called himſelf <hi>Don Jeronimo.</hi> She bought rich Houſhod Goods, ſuitable to a Widow of Quality, and was accordingly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by the principal Ladies of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, who were extreamly pleaſed with the Charms both of her Beauty and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Going every Day to Maſs in the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:109316:66"/> of the young Beau's of the City, and ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing newly come to <hi>Toledo,</hi> ſeveral young Sparks were taken with her Beauty, and made their Addreſſes to her.</p>
               <p>While ſhe was informing herſelf who was the Richeſt and likely to have the moſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that ſhe might not forget her old Trade for want of Practice, we ſhall leave her, and take a turn to <hi>Malaga,</hi> to ſee what became of <hi>Criſpin</hi> after his Eſcape out of Priſon.</p>
               <p>Finding himſelf once more at Liberty, he left <hi>Malaga,</hi> and got into a Wood not far from the City, where he continued all Night, and then went into the Hermitage, where he had lived many Years with the Repute of a Saint. As ſoon as he was convicted of the Crimes laid to his Charge, another Hermit who was counted a pious Man, ſucceeded in his place, who went about to ſeveral Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, begging Alms to build a little Hoſpital for Strangers in that place. He was not quite ſetled in the Hermitage, the Place not being yet furniſhed, <hi>Criſpin</hi> got thither in the night, and found a place where he had laid up ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt a rainy Day; breaking up the Ground, he came to a little Earthen Pot, wherein was a Bag, and in it all the Money he had reſerved of all the Robberies he had been Engaged in.</p>
               <p>With that Sum, which might amount to 5 or 600 Pound Sterling all in Gold, he went to the City of <hi>Jaen,</hi> where he had a Friend of the ſame Occupation. This Comrade of his heard how he had got out of Priſon, whereat he was very glad, being before apprehenſive that he might have confeſs'd upon the Rack,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:109316:66"/> both engaged together. He received him with great Affection, in hopes of his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and aſſiſtance in ſome new Enterpriſes; <hi>Criſpin</hi> was but meanly accoutred, as having been uncaſed of the Hermit's Habit, which he ſhewed himſelf unworthy of; but the Bag he brought ſo well lin'd, was a ſovereign remedy againſt Nakedneſs. He gave his Companion money to buy a light colour'd Suit of Cloaths and a Perriwig, cutting off his long Beard, which with a Sword by his ſide, alter'd him ſo much, that he ſeem'd quite another Man. In that Equipage he continued ſome time at <hi>Jaen,</hi> till there happened an Opportunity to commit a conſiderable Robbery at <hi>Andujar,</hi> and the Booty, was nicely divided between him and his Companion. But fearing diligent Search would be made after them for this Prank, <hi>Criſpin</hi> thought it his beſt Courſe to be gone from thence in time, the Adventure at <hi>Malaga</hi> being ſtill freſh in his Mind.</p>
               <p>They took into their Company a third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom they met with by chance; a young Man born in the City of <hi>Valentia,</hi> they then came to <hi>Toledo.</hi> Their young Accomplice was called <hi>Javino,</hi> a poor Rope-maker's Son of <hi>Valencia,</hi> who for ſome Roguiſh Exploits he had done there, whereby he had gained a conſiderable Sum of Money, was obliged to abſent himſelf from thence for ſeveral Years.

                  <p>There happened to be ſome in the ſtreet who knew me, and made Oath that I was the man who had done the Miſchief to my Rival; Upon this accident I retired from thence, for he was ſo dangerouſly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his Recovery was deſpair'd of; I ſaw his Friends were reſolv'd to revenge his Death, and was afraid to fall into the hands of Juſtice. This obliged me to leave <hi>Valentia</hi> and come to this City, where I have been about a month, I have ſince underſtood by a Gentleman of that Country that Don <hi>Vincent</hi> is out of all danger, and in perfect health, and that the Treaty of Marriage between him and Donna <hi>Sentillana</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, whereof I have a greater Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than of having this day met with 2 Men who being hired by my Rival came hither on purpoſe to Murder me.

                  <hi>Javino</hi> having made this Progreſs in his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, went and gave his Fellow-Thieves an Account thereof, appointed them to wait about the Houſe where the Money was, he undertaking to amuſe the Comedians ſo long till they had done their Work, which, would not be long, ſince they had all their Picklocks and Implements ready for Men of their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The Players on the other ſide, prepared all things to ſhew the Poet ſuch a Trick as they thought his Extravagance deſerv'd, preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing ſome Squibs and Crackers, (if poſſible) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:109316:80"/> left, though it proved to their Loſs in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel.</p>
               <p>At the Hour appointed, the Sham-Poet came to the Houſe to which he was invited. He who expected him, had provided what was Requiſite to make Sport enough that Night for the whole Company; and ſeeing them all met, ſaid, the Room was too narrow for 'em, and that they had better remove to the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, where they ſhould not be Diſturbed. The feign'd Poet was glad at this Offer, becauſe thereby the Coaſt would be clear about the chief Comedian's Houſe, and his Comerades might more eaſily diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tch their Affair. It happen'd to his Wiſh; for the Miſtreſs of the Houſe, who heard her Husband and others of the Company Talk of the Extravagant Poet, and how they intended to ſerve him, would needs ſee the Sport; and leſt it might be late e're they return'd home, ſhe took all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants along with her and left the Houſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty. They brought the Poet to the Theatre with a great deal of Ceremony, and placed him at the end of a Table on which there were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Candles. Having taken one of his Comedies out of his Pocket, and the Company ſilently expecting, after 2 or 3 Grave Hem's, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Read the Verſes, but after ſuch a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous and Fooliſh Manner, that when he had gone over about a Hundred of them, the Players perceiving that the Piece contain'd many Sheets cloſe-written, and Tired with the Impertinence of what they had already heard, and that they had ſpent the Night ſo ſimply, interrupted the Reciter with a kind of Buzzing Noiſe. That was the Cue which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:109316:81"/> Angry, and clapp'd his Hands with ſuch Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on the Table, that he ſhook the Candle-ſticks, and cried out, aloud, <hi>Tacete! Tacete!</hi> Hold your Peace! Be Quiet! But the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and others not underſtanding <hi>Latin,</hi> the Hurry increas'd, the Table was overturn'd, and the Candles put out, and all retiring from him, they ſet Fire to the Train laid for the poor Poet. He found himſelf beſet with a number of Squibs, Crackers, and long Bags full of Sand, like Snakes, all in open Hoſtility againſt him. He was in a very deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for there was nothing but Confuſion on the Theatre, beſides the Flames of Roſin, which came up beneath the Stage, and were ready to Choak him, enough to Cure him of all thoughts of Poetry for the future. He ſeem'd to take it very unkindly, that he had been brought thither to receive ſuch an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front; for beſides the danger his Tinder Cloak and Caſſock were in of a general Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he loſt his Comedy, pretending that a greater Damage could not have befallen him.</p>
               <p>The Epilogue of the Comedy was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Tragical to the Players, ſince <hi>Javino</hi>'s Confederates, while the Company was thus Entertained at the Theatre, had found a way into the Comedian's Houſe, and examin'd all the Cheſts and Trunks that ſtood in their way, in one whereof they found the Money they lookt for, which they carried to <hi>Javino</hi>'s Houſe where it was equally divided.</p>
               <p>The next Day, the Comedian going to take out ſome Cloaths, was much ſurpriz'd to find the Cheſt open. He ask'd his Wife who had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He fell Sick out of pure Diſcontent, and kept his Bed, and then began to doubt, that it was a Trick put upon him by the pretended Poet, for whom he had made ſtrict Search, tho' in vain.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Officers of Juſtice were upon their Duty, to find whether ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Poet they could find the Thief. At length they happen'd to ſeize one of <hi>Javino</hi>'s Companions upon Suſpicion, who being put to the Torture, confeſs'd the whole Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; and by his Directions, <hi>Javino, Roſina,</hi> and all the reſt of the Confederates, were taken and ſent to Priſon, and they unanimouſly declaring, that <hi>Javino</hi> and his Wife were the only Contrivers of the Robbery, who Liv'd likewiſe at a high Rate, without any Viſible Eſtate, and having none to ſpeak for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, the two former were Sentenced to be Hang'd, and their Comerades Condemn'd to the Gallies.</p>
